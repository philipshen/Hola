# Hola

## Introduction

Hola is a tool for automated integration testing in iOS. You can use it to send requests from an iOS device or simulator to locally-running backend. It is a work in progress.

## Plans

Features planned include: 

* A way to cache sets of responses during testing and test against them later, a la [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)
* General, arbitrary proxying
* Ability to mock responses as needed by tests, to make it easier to isolate pieces of functionality being tested
